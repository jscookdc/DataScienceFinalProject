# DataScienceFinalProject
This was my final project in STA112: Introduction to Data Science at Wake Forest University. This project is a showcase of some of my abilities in the statistical computing language R. The project uses the assigned data from my class; a deeper description can be found within the file.

project_2_james_cook.Rmd is an R Markdown file which contains all of the code I created to generate charts and statistics.
project_2_james_cook.html is the knit output of that R Markdown file, a presentable front-end format.
